* Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as Content Management Systems. In this homework assignment, your challenge is to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

## Instructions

* Build a command-line application that at a minimum allows the user to:
* Add departments, roles, employees
* View departments, roles, employees
* Update employee roles
* Bonus points if you're able to:
* Update employee managers
* View employees by manager
* Delete departments, roles, and employees
* View the total utilized budget of a department -- ie the combined salaries of all employees in that department
